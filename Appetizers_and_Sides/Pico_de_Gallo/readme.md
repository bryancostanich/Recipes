# Pico de Gallo

Fresh salsa for tacos or tortilla chips.

## Ingredients

* (1) Red Onion (Chopped)
* (3-4) Roma Tomatoes (Chopped) (1:1 ratio of onions to tomatoes)
* (3 limes) Lime Juice
* (4-5 cloves) Garlic (finely minced) 
* (1/3rd bunch) Cilantro
* (2 Tsp) Fresh ground pepper
* (1/2) Jalapeno
* Salt to taste (1-2 Tsp probably)

## Instructs

* Chop the onion and tomatoes, finely mince the garlic, then mix everything together in a bowl. 
* Squeeze lime juice in, grind some salt and mix up. 
* Give the salt a moment to mix with the liquids then taste. Add salt as necessary.

## Misc. Tips

* **Cilantro** - The stems are some of the most flavorful part, and they're also nice crunch. When you get your cilantro, take off the wire bands/rubber bands, etc., chop off enough of the bottoms so that they have a fresh cut. Then put them in a cup of water in the fridge, they'll keep fresh and lively for a week or more that way.
