# Caesar Salad

[Invented by Caesar Cardini in 1927 @ Caesar's Hotel, Tijuana.](https://www.hotelcaesars.com.mx/en/caesars-salad/) There's a yearly Caesar`s Salad Festival that takes place on Revoluci√≥n Avenue between 4th and 5th streets every June.

Originally made with worcestire for umami, not anchovies, I prefer both.
