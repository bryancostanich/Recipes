# Whole Roasted Chicken

This is a super easy and economical way to get chicken meat, and after you carve the meat off, you can throw everything left into a pot with water and boil overnight for bone stock.

## Ingredients

* (1) Whole Chicken
* [Spicy Olive Oil Marinade](../../Marinades/Spicy_Chili_Olive_Oil/readme.md)
* (2 Tbsp) Rosemary

## Instructs

1. Pull neck out and innards out of chicken (if included).
2. Rinse chicken under cold water and let exess water drip off.
3. Place whole chicken, breast down, in a square casserole dish. Place neck and organs (gizzard, heart, liver, etc.) next to it in dish.
4. Rub with olive oil marinade.
5. Sprinkle rosemary on top.
6. Cover with aluminum foil.
7. Bake @ `350°` for `15 minutes` + `20 minutes` for every `1lb` of chicken. For instance, if you have a `5lb` chicken, bake for `120 minutes` : (`20 minutes` + `100 minutes (15 minutes * 5 lbs)`). Chicken is done when breast hits `165°`. Depending on your oven, it may be faster or slower.
