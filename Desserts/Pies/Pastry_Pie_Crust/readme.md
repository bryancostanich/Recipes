# Pastry Pie Crust

Pastry pie crust typically follow a 3:1, flour to fat ratio. For fat, I typically split that into 1/2 butter and 1/2 animal fat, with my preference being bacon grease. Butter alone will not hold together. For a vegetarian option, use vegetable shortening.

## Ingredients

* (3 Cup) Flour
* (1 Cup) Fat - (1/2 Cup) Butter, (1/2 Cup Bacon Grease, Lard, or Vegetable Shortening)
* (1 Tsp) Salt
* Cold Water (approximately 1/3 cup).

## Instructs

1. In a mixer, add flour and salt.
2. If butter is frozen or cold, soften in the microwave by putting the butter in a bowl, cover, and nuke for 30 seconds.
3. Add warm butter to mix.
4. Add secondary fat to mix.
5. With a whisk attachment, mix everything togethr, starting on low and then increasing speed, until fat is _cut_ in (should be lots of small little balls).
6. Change mixer attachment to a kneader, start mixing again on low speed, and add cold water until the dough has almost a play-dough texture. Mix just enough to be combined.
7. Combine dough pieces into one, then split roughly in half (one can be slightly larger for bottom piece).
8. Place dough pieces in two bowls fridge until ready to use.

## Notes

* When adding water to mix dough, you'll know if it's too dry when you roll it out and there's a lot of cracking. Too wet, and it'll be sticky.
