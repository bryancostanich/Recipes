# Asado (Chicken/Pollo, Elk, etc.)

Mexican marinade for taco meats and such.

## Ingredients

* (3/4 Cup) Soy sauce
* (3/4 Cup) Orange juice
* (3 limes) Lime juice
* (2 Tbsp) Sesame Oil
* (1 TBsp) Ground red chili
* (1 Tsp) Cayenne
* (1/3 bunch) Cilantro (Chopped)
* (2 Tsp) Smoked paprika
* (1/3 Cup) Red wine vinegar
* (2 Tsp) Fresh Ground Pepper
* (2 Tbsp) Chopped Garlic
* (1/2) Jalapeno (or more)

## Instructs

1. Slice meat so you have pancake thick pieces. If using chicken, you'll slice the breasts horizontally.
2. Mix all asado ingredients.
3. Pour some asado in a container, layer meat and asado so every surface has asado. Close container, mix a bit, and marinate for 4hrs+. 

## Notes

It's ok to marinate for up to 4 or 5 days in advance, the acid keeps bacteria at bay.
